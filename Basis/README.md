# CF-Basis

CF-Basis is a lightweight framework inspired by FW/1 with a couple of additions. These 
additions include a simple proxy for AJAX requests, basic Service and DAO objects,
and a simple plugin architecture.

Does CFML need another framework? *Absolutely not.* This is simply a small framework
that I've written a few applications with and decided to share with world.

CF-Basis is provided free and can be used how you please. It is provided under the 
2-clause BSD license.
